    <p>I am Adrita Khan, a dedicated Physics graduate majoring in Physics and a minor in Astronomy from Universiti Sains Malaysia (University of Science, Malaysia).</p>

    <p>I am also well-versed in multiple programming languages, data analysis, and data visualization techniques, which I acquired through a diverse set of autodidactic courses and practical experiences.</p>

    <p>My dedication to the field of Physics extends beyond the classroom. I have engaged in research, including my undergraduate thesis on "A Probabilistic Batemanâ€™s Equation Solver for Simulating Complex Nuclear Decay Chains." Additionally, I am currently involved in ongoing research papers focused on detecting exoplanets using machine learning techniques and studying the relationships among black hole mass, galactic mass, and bulge galactic mass.</p>

    <p>My commitment to fostering STEM education is evident through my teaching experiences. I have served as a private home tutor, providing one-on-one science instruction to high school students. I tailored my lessons to meet individual student needs, monitored progress, and collaborated with parents to ensure the best possible learning outcomes. Moreover, I have gained valuable experience in teaching and mentorship as an instructor and mentor in Penang, Malaysia, where I guided undergraduate students in their Physics coursework and facilitated group study sessions and workshops.</p>

    <p>In addition to my teaching roles, I have also honed my technical and writing skills. I have taken on freelance writing tasks, specializing in creative and persuasive writing, business communication, and technical writing. My proficiency in referencing styles and content paraphrasing has allowed me to excel in this area.</p>

    <p>My programming languages proficiency includes Python, Julia, MATLAB, Wolfram Mathematica, R, and basic knowledge of C and C++. I am also well-versed in web development, database management, and various operating systems.</p>

    <p>As a lifelong learner, I have continuously sought opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. I have completed several autodidactic courses, including those related to teaching with technology, modern physics, thermodynamics, and data-driven astronomy. My commitment to learning is further reflected in my IELTS score of 7.5, with a notable speaking band score.</p>

    <p>Outside the academic realm, I have been recognized for my achievements, including being listed on the Dean's List for outstanding academic performance and participating in prestigious events such as the Spelling Bee National Round and the Bangladesh Astro Olympiad National Round. I have also actively engaged in extracurricular activities, such as stargazing, science outreach, and community involvement, as a member of the Astronomy Club and the Physical Science Society at Universiti Sains Malaysia.</p>

    <p>I am fluent in Bengali and English, with working proficiency in Hindi/Urdu and basic knowledge of German.</p>

    <p>With my comprehensive educational background, strong technical skills, and a passion for teaching and research, I am dedicated to making a significant impact in the field of physics and astronomy. I am always open to engaging discussions and am eager to share my insights and knowledge to contribute positively to our collective understanding of these exciting disciplines. Feel free to reach out to me for any questions or discussions you may have â€“ I'm here to help and collaborate.</p>
